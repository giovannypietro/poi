## What We're Building

Proof-of-Intent (PoI) is a cryptographic approach to AI agent security that moves beyond traditional IAM from "who can do what" to "why are they doing it, right now, on whose behalf, and with what justification?"

Our goal is to create:
- **Tamper-evident receipts** for AI agent actions
- **Cryptographic binding** between capabilities and agent lineage
- **Provable accountability** at machine speed
- **Auditable trust** in autonomous systems

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of IAM and security concepts
- Familiarity with JSON and API design
- Interest in AI agent security
- Git and GitHub experience (helpful but not required)

### Setup
1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/poi.git
   cd poi
   ```
3. **Add the upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/giovannypietro/poi.git
   ```

### First Contribution
- Start with something small like documentation improvements
- Check the [Issues](../../issues) page for "good first issue" labels
- Join [GitHub Discussions](../../discussions) to get familiar with the community

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- **Main branch**: Stable, production-ready code
- **Feature branches**: `feature/description-of-feature`
- **Bug fix branches**: `fix/description-of-bug`
- **Documentation branches**: `docs/description-of-changes`

### Workflow Steps
1. **Create a branch** from main:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. **Make your changes** and commit them:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: description of what you added"
   ```
3. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub

### Commit Messages
Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
- **Format**: `type: description of changes`
- **Types**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`
- **Examples**:
  - `feat: add support for custom capability scopes`
  - `fix: resolve timestamp validation issue`
  - `docs: improve schema field descriptions`

## Code Standards

### General Principles
- **Readability**: Code should be easy to understand
- **Consistency**: Follow established patterns
- **Documentation**: Comment complex logic
- **Testing**: Include tests for new functionality

### Style Guidelines
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Add comments for complex business logic
- Follow the existing code style in the project

### Security Considerations
- **Input validation**: Always validate and sanitize inputs
- **Cryptographic operations**: Use established, secure libraries
- **Error handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors
- **Access control**: Implement proper authorization checks

## Documentation

### What to Document
- **New features**: How they work and how to use them
- **API changes**: Updated endpoints and parameters
- **Configuration**: New options and their effects
- **Examples**: Real-world usage scenarios

### Documentation Standards
- Use clear, concise language
- Include practical examples
- Keep information up-to-date
- Use consistent formatting and structure

### Where to Document
- **README.md**: High-level project overview
- **SCHEMA.md**: Detailed field definitions and validation
- **Code comments**: Inline documentation for complex logic
- **Examples**: Sample implementations and use cases

## Testing

### Test Types
- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions and components
- **Integration tests**: Test how components work together
- **Schema validation**: Ensure JSON receipts are valid
- **Security tests**: Verify cryptographic operations

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test files
npm test -- --grep "schema validation"

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Writing Tests
- Test both valid and invalid inputs
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names
- Keep tests focused and independent
